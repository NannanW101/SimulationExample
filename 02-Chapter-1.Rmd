## Coin Flipping Simulation
```{r}
# The following code simulates the number of head obtained from flipping a coin 10 times. 
resultContainer <- numeric(length=10)
for (i in 1: 10){
# in each trail, there are only two possible outcomes, 0 represents tail and 1 represents head. 
  resultContainer[i] <- sample(0:1,1)
}
# Each value in the resultContainer represents result from flipping the coin each time, since one repetition contains 10 trails, there are 10 values in resultContainer. 
resultContainer
# sumHead represents the total number of head obtained from flipping the coin 10 times. 
sumHead <- sum(resultContainer)
sumHead
```

## Doris & Buzz Simulation
```{r}
# oneRep saves result of one repetion (16 trails). In each trial, outcome is 0 or 1. 
oneRep <- rep(NA,16)
# container saves result of all 100 replications.  
container <- t(replicate(100,oneRep))
for (i in 1:100) {
  for (j in 1:16){
    # 0 stands for Buzz guessing wrong and 1 stands for Buzz guessing correctly. 
    container[i,j] <- sample(0:1,1)
  }
}
# calculate number of head in each replication and save the result in the dis100Rep vector
dis100Rep <- rowSums(container)
# create a dataframe "simulatedDisM" saving result for each repetition
repLabel <- 1:100
simulatedDis <- cbind(repLabel,dis100Rep)
simulatedDisM <- as.data.frame(simulatedDis)
head(simulatedDisM)
# plot the resulted dataframe in a dot plot. 
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(simulatedDisM, aes(x = dis100Rep)) +
  geom_dotplot(method="histodot",binwidth = 0.2)+
  theme(
    axis.text.y=element_blank(),  #remove y axis labels
    axis.ticks.y=element_blank()  #remove y axis ticks
  )+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(1:16))+
  labs(x="Number of Head")
