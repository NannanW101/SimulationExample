## Coin Flipping Simulation
```{r}
# The following code simulates the number of head obtained from flipping a coin 10 times. 
resultContainer <- numeric(length=10)
for (i in 1: 10){
# in each trail, there are only two possible outcomes, 0 represents tail and 1 represents head. 
  resultContainer[i] <- sample(0:1,1)
}
# Each value in the resultContainer represents result from flipping the coin each time, since one repetition contains 10 trails, there are 10 values in resultContainer. 
resultContainer
# sumHead represents the total number of head obtained from flipping the coin 10 times. 
sumHead <- sum(resultContainer)
sumHead
```

## Doris & Buzz Simulation
```{r}
# The following code simulates the number of times Buzz guesses correctly out of 16 trials
# BuzzGuess saves the result of Buzz guessing each time
BuzzGuess <- numeric(length=10) # change 10 to 16 because there are 16 trials in each repetition
for (i in 1: 10){ # change 10 to 16 for the same reason
# in each trail, there are only two possible outcomes, 0 represents guessing wrong and 1 represents guessing correctly 
  BuzzGuess[i] <- sample(0:1,1)
}
BuzzGuess
sumGuess <- sum(BuzzGuess)
# sumGuess stands for the number of times Buzz guesses correctly. 
sumGuess
```
